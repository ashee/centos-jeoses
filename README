# centos-jeoses
This project is an attempt to create a minimalistic
CentOS/RHEV 5.6 install using kickstart files

These have been tested using qemu/kvm. 

The kickstarts have postinstall scripts that 
performs some administrative tasks like setting
up /etc/sudoers file, setting up user account,
and install ssh public key for key based login.

Rename the kickstart file to ks.cfg and copy them
into the floppy image.

Pass the following parameter at install prompt

linux asknetwork ks=floppy

## ks-min.cfg
This is the bare minimum server install. It installs
161 packages, consumes ~90MB of RAM and ~780 MB of disk

## ks-dev.cfg
This is the bare minimum packages needed to build software
packages from source.
